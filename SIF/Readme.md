Analytical and empirical solutions to engineering problems are usually preferred because of their convenience in applications. However, they are not always accessible in complex problems. A new class of solutions based on machine learning models are proposed and their feasibility and value are demonstrated through analysis of fracture toughness measurements. This example demonstrates that these **machine learning solutions** are a major improvement for analytical and empirical solutions in terms of both **reliable functionality** and **fast deployment**. When analytical solutions are not available, the exploitation of machine learning solutions can overcome the limitations of empirical solutions and substantially change the way that engineering problems are solved.
